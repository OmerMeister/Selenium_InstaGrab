# dp1003-InstaGrab
(dp=devops project)  
Demonstrate selenium capabilities (using python) to scrap an instagram-viewer website. Uses various python classes, and perform error-handling.  
I first tried to scrape stright from instagram but of course they are aware of that and made it very difficult.  
Moreover, they know almost always enforce login even for viewing a public profile. Due to that i chose for myself a more easy target.
Due to the nature of scraping projects, the html,css and page layout of the target site might change and make the script absolete. Eventhough, with small ajustments to the target elements, most of the file and error handling is relevant.
### a full readme will come up later, for meanwhile theres plenty of documentation in the code itself
